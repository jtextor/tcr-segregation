# data availability 
Raw sequencing data is available on NCBI via BioProject PRJNA776826 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA776826). The sequencing protocol is available on Zenodo (10.5281/zenodo.5862237). The folder <i>data</i> in this repository contains the processed sequence data. 

The repository contains samples from mice in naive state, three days after antigen challenge, and four days after antigen challenge. Samples from three mice were taken from the blood (B<sub>i</sub>) and, per mouse, from two different T cell zones in the spleen (S<sub>i</sub>) in naive state. To evaluate whether and how the segregation of TCR repertoires across T cell zones changes during an immune response, SRBC, were injected into three mice. Three days after injection a sample from the blood (B3<sub>i</sub>) and two splenic T cell zones (S3<sub>i</sub>) were collected from each mouse. To determine how long the within-host segregation of TCR repertoires persists, SRBC were injected into three more mice. A sample from the blood (B4<sub>i</sub>) and two T cell zones (S4<sub>i</sub>) were collected from each mouse 4 days after injection.
